    a = 'University leaders ban pro - life flag display , say it ‘ created an unsafe environment \'. Pro - life students at Wilfrid Laurier University say they will no longer be able to put up their pro - life flag display , with campus leaders explaining such exhibits are too traumatic after one last fall caused an uproar on the Canadian campus . <splt> The display used 10,000 pink and blue flags to represent the 100,000 abortions each year in Canada . <splt> Student Union President Tyler Van Herzele , in a letter shared campuswide , stated that " the visceral nature of the display interfered with the ability of some members of the Laurier community to safely attend class , travel to work or remain on campus to study . " <splt> " The adversarial tone of the event evoked a confrontation which eliminated the possibility of respectful dialogue and created an unsafe environment for all students . " <splt> According to his December 2016 letter , several offices , including the Diversity and Equity Office , have worked together " to ensure this does not happen again . " <splt> In an email to The College Fix this month , campus spokesman Kevin Crowley echoed such sentiments . <splt> He noted the university " firmly upholds the principles of free speech and strives to provide an environment that protects the right of all people to engage in critical and respectful dialogue . " <splt> But , he added , " we must , however , balance the exercise of free speech with the need to support individuals who may have experienced harm related to a specific topic being discussed . " <splt> The display in question was a project of the school \'s LifeLink group . <splt> It was set up in October on the quad , with approval from the student union . <splt> Earlier this month , Christine Schuknecht , a student at the university \'s Waterloo campus and a member of LifeLink , wrote for National Post about what led to such a display being banned . <splt> After the flags had been up for several hours , students and university employees took action against it , according to Schuknect . <splt> The Diversity and Equity Office placed a sign by the display reading " Warning : Anti - Choice display ahead . " <splt> Special Constable Services were called after students vandalized flags and the club banner and yelled at LifeLink members . <splt> The constables did not see any issue with the display and commended members , she wrote . <splt> Schuknect explains she was " dumbfounded . " <splt> The Diversity and Equity Office , she wrote , was supposed to be " non - partisan , " but had used " anti - choice " to describe her club . <splt> " The DEO hangs posters across my campus insisting that students use ‘ proper terms \' when addressing the groups it explicitly supports , but went out of its way to apply a negatively torqued label to ours , " Schuknect wrote . <splt> Jonah Vanleeuwen , the group \'s vice - president , echoed sentiments of surprise and disappointment . <splt> " I was very disappointed to see that despite our efforts to stay peaceful and reserved , the group using violent tactics was being raised on a pedestal , " he said in an email to The College Fix . <splt> Students spoke out about the display in other ways . <splt> The Cord , the campus newspaper , published " Anti - abortion demonstration in the Quad , " which wrote those at the university " were surprised " to see the flags . <splt> The article included statements from Daniel Quintia , a third - year student who admitted to pulling out some of the flags , saying he was " just frankly kind of pissed . " <splt> The Diversity and Equity Office referred The College Fix to the Student Union when emailed for comment . <splt> Van Herzele failed to respond to emails or phone calls from The Fix . <splt> MORE : Washington State student tears down pro - life display because it ‘ really made me angry \' <splt> MORE : Student pro - life display casually vandalized in broad daylight at CU - Boulder <splt> Like The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter'
